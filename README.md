#### Access to Cohort Orgs:
You need access to Cohort Orgs to perform code reviews and general insight of material on a phase. To accomplish this you have been added to the SF-Mentors team on GitHub. This team will be invited to each incoming cohort org, granting you full access to all material therein.

Access Issues: Ensure that you have accepted the invitation from Github for each active Cohort, else contact Mentor Coordinator.

#### Giving and Receiving Feedback:
- Complete the [Weekly Mentor Survey](https://docs.google.com/a/devbootcamp.com/forms/d/1aYZX7t737QJcIxmb25DCwcYPzKsxzgmiz_COOHjxj0I/viewform) weekly to talk about your experiences.
- Student feedback for Mentors will be collected during the weekly retro survey.
- You are required to solicit some student feedback each phase you work. This feedback will be reviewed by the Mentor Coordinator. Use the Give a [Mentor feedback form](https://docs.google.com/a/devbootcamp.com/forms/d/17gVpZgsiadJ9OblHMmxroAWAZcbKaQSyJzJ7Kpx-sbc/viewform). This link will also be in the students guide.

#### Optional Meetings:
- 1st Monday of Phase @ 6:15 -- Mentor powwow with Mentor Coordinator. Feel free to attend if you have questions or concerns.
- 1st Monday of Phase @ 7:00 -- Meet the Mentors for incoming Cohort.

## Sessions

A session is time that you book to Mentor @ DBC. If you book a session you are expected to show up for that time slot. Session booking will be cross-referenced to your Workday submissions.

#### Signing Up For Sessions:
Mentors are added to the Mentor Appointments Calendar after they are accepted to the program. If you cannot access this Google calendar, email the Mentor Coordinator for assistance.

- Mentor sessions can be created on the Mentor Appointments Calendar.
- Some sessions are assigned by the Mentor Coordinator or Phase Lead either because they are phase specific sessions during core hours, or a particular mentor has requested to own that session (IE. white-boarding Wednesdays).
- It is useful if you book sessions a few days ahead of time so students and other Mentors know what support to expect, but they may be claimed as you walk in the door.

- See the video below for a demo. **coming soon**

#### Session Constraints:
It is your responsibility to ensure your session does not exceed these limits. Any work outside these limits will not be deemed billable hours.

- **Maximum of 5 Mentors** can book after hours sessions each day.
- **Maximum of 20 hours** per week for each Mentor.
- There is also a weekly maximum for all Mentors see the [FAQ](#faq).

#### Finding Coverage For Sessions:
If you book a session on the calendar but are unable to make it:

  1. Go to your Google calendar page and make sure that the DBC::SF Mentor Calendar is the only one selected. If you have your personal calendar displayed as well, you may inadvertently delete the session from your personal calendar instead of the DBC calendar. This means your old session WILL STILL BE VISIBLE on the DBC calendar, even though it is gone from your own calendar. You need to be sure to delete directly from the DBC calendar.
  2. Click on the session you need to delete and then click the "Delete" link.

#### Before Your Session:
- Review the challenges the students will be working by checking each of their phase guides. You can access these through the mentor GitHub account.

#### During Your Session:
- Write your name and session time on the board.
- Let the students know you're available.
- Sit at one of the tables at the end of the student workstations so you're easily accessible.
- Check frequently for post-it flags on the computers.
- Take walks up and down the aisles every so often - some students don't ask questions unless you pass by.
- Nudge them in the right direction but don't give them the answer. Use your laptop to look up solutions from past cohorts if you're stuck.
- Don't spend too much time being stuck with a student - if you can't get them moving forward, ask another mentor or instructor.
- Additionally, you can do code reviews. See [below](#how-to-claim-a-pull-request-for-a-code-review) for instructions on how to do code reviews.
- If you're getting a lot of the same questions, consider doing a breakout on a topic. Check to see if the students would like one, and consider checking in with the phase and/or cohort lead to see if there's any info from their lecture that they would like you to reinforce.

#### After Your Session:
- Remove your name from the board.
- Complete the [End of Session](https://docs.google.com/a/devbootcamp.com/forms/d/1bNIBtgy2ephY5117eHa31iFVgVRxPJAA0zzyeEqvTlA/viewform) form.

#### Fixed Sessions:
Fixed sessions are workshops conducted by a Mentor. They can occur anytime after 6 on weekdays, or anytime over the weekend. Once scheduled, a fixed session should occur at the same time and interval. Mentors working on a fixed session may bill a limited number of 'prep hours' in addition to the actual time of the session.

There are several fixed sessions available. If someone hasn't claimed a session you are interested in email the Mentor Coordinator to discuss picking it up.
  - White-boarding Wednesdays (John Akers)
  - Intro to Git Workflow - Week 2 Monday (Cari Westbrook)
  - Intro to Sinatra - Phase transition Sunday (Jason Lo)
  - Intro to Javascript
  - Intro to Rails


#### How To Submit Your Hours in Workday:
[Video Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7uFhzfRtRRGSWlaWk1MS0ttb3gzaWJYenp3dlhPYl9nM253/view?usp=sharing)

1. Login
2. Go to the Time page
3. Submit daily session totals from the SF Mentor Calendar


### Code Review

Mentors are required to complete code reviews for students. Minimum 5 per phase.
Downtime during scheduled hours is a great time to knock this out.

#### How To Claim A Pull Request For A Code Review:
1. Click on the notifications icon in the upper right hand corner. Select "All Notifications" in the left-hand menu and check for any notifications that does not have the wizard hat image next to the time-stamp ("4 days ago", "1 hour ago", etc).
2. Click on the un-wizard-hatted pull request and check to be sure an instructor hasn't already reviewed the code in the comments. If no one has commented yet, leave a note with your name stating that you'll do the code review.
3. Complete this during your session - please do not leave the students hanging until the next time you work.
4. Do not work on code that has already been claimed.

#### How To Complete A Code Review:
1. After claiming it in the comments, click on the "File Changes" link directly above the student's initial comment.
2. Review the code in green, which indicates the changes that were made by the student to the file. Code in white was provided to them as part of the challenge.
3. Leave a comment in-line by clicking on the plus sign of the line in question and filling out the comment box.
4. When finished, click on the "Conversations" link and fill out a final summary comment ("Good job", "Here's a resource you may find useful", etc). Click "Close and Comment".

#### Removal from the program:
Mentors are expected to uphold the three agreements and location specific rules at all times.  Failure to do so will result in removal from the program.

Mentors are expected to work at least 5 hours a month to remain active in the program.  Mentors working less than this will be contacted and asked to increase their hours or to retire from the program if they do not wish to work the minimum.  Retired mentors can re-apply to the program at a later time.

### FAQ

_Is the 5 hours per month a minimum per month, or an average over multiple months?_

This is per month.  Since mentors are now part time employees, there is a limit to the number that we can have active.  We would like our active mentors to meet a minimum level of engagement. If you are planning a trip that will prohibit you from meeting this minimum you may speak wit the Mentor Coordinator about a waiver.

---

_What is the maximum number of mentor hours that can be worked in a week?_

This is based on the number of students on-site. It is currently 100 hours, with 60 hours being reserved for phase leads to schedule during day hours and 40 available for nights and weekends.  At a max it will be 166 hours with 120 reserved for day hours and 46 available for nights and weekends.
This number may change based on student demand and mentor availability.

You can check the total hours booked via [Google Calendar Hours](http://google-calendar-hours.com/). Mentors will be notified if the program is approaching this limit by the Mentor Coordinator.

_What are the details of the commuter benefits?_

The Commuter Benefits Program allows you to set aside pre-tax money for out-of-pocket, work-related parking and/or mass transit commuting expenses. Your election may be changed monthly, based on your changing transit needs. Expenses are limited to eligible commuter parking and/or mass transit expenses incurred by you. Examples of eligible expenses can include a paid parking facility at or near your place or work, commuter trains, subways, buses, ferries, and van pooling (with at least six passengers). For parking you may set aside up to $250 per month in 2015. For mass transit, you may set aside up to $130 per month in 2015.

_For things like coordinating the phase transition workshop (Intro to Sinatra), how does that fit into the booking sessions?_

We have Fixed Sessions on the calendar for existing events.  These will be pre-assigned to the main person (though if that person can’t do it they can pass it off). For example Whiteboard Wednesday will be a pre-assigned Fixed Session that is automatically assigned to Amelia (or John). Also Sinatra Workshop would be on the Fixed Session.  The mentor who wants to run this would need to connect with the Mentor Coordinator to set the time and day.

If there are additional Fixed Sessions that any mentor would like to have - they can request this from the Mentor Coordinator who will assess the number of mentoring hours available against the need for such a session.

---

_Are there opportunities for title advancement/pay increase?_

Currently there are no opportunities for title advancement or pay increase. Mentors that have been doing particular activities will be given preference for doing these.

There may be title advancement in the future - we’ll need to get the program up and running first.

There will not be opportunities for pay increase.
