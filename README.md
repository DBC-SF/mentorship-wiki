#### Scheduling Constraints:

Mentors are broken down into two groups:

- Core-Hour Mentors should schedule hours between **10:00 and 19:00**.
- Non-Core-Hour (Evenings && Weekends) Mentors should schedule hours between **18:00 - 22:00** during the week && **10:00 - 22:00** on the weekends.

It is your responsibility to ensure your session does not exceed these constraints. Any work outside these limits will not be deemed billable hours.

- **Maximum of 20 hours** per week per Mentor.
- **Maximum of 120 hours** per week for **All Mentors**. Find current status @ [Mentor Calendar Hours](http://google-calendar-hours.com/).
- **Maximum of 6 hours** per day for core-hour Mentors.
- **Maximum of 4 Mentors** can book non-core hours each day.
- **Maximum of 3 hours** per day for non-core Mentors unless a specific waiver is granted by the Mentor Coordinator.
- **Maximum 2 weeks** advanced booking of slots on the calendar.

This cap is dynamic and will be adjusted to meet student needs by the Mentor Coordinator.

Additional Info in the [FAQ](faq.md).

#### Access to Cohort Orgs:
You need access to Cohort Orgs to perform code reviews and gain general insight of material on a phase.

Currently - If you are working a phase and require access to the org email the Mentor Coordinator to be added in.

Future Goal -- To accomplish this you have been added to the SF-Mentors team on GitHub. This team will be invited to each incoming Cohort Org, granting you full access to all material therein. Access Issues: Ensure that you have accepted the invitation from Github for each active Cohort, else contact Mentor Coordinator.

#### Giving and Receiving Feedback:
- Complete the [Weekly Mentor Survey](https://docs.google.com/a/devbootcamp.com/forms/d/1aYZX7t737QJcIxmb25DCwcYPzKsxzgmiz_COOHjxj0I/viewform) weekly to talk about your experiences.
- Student feedback for Mentors will be collected during the weekly retro survey.
- You are required to solicit some student feedback each phase you work. This feedback will be reviewed by the Mentor Coordinator. Use the give a [Mentor feedback form](https://docs.google.com/a/devbootcamp.com/forms/d/17gVpZgsiadJ9OblHMmxroAWAZcbKaQSyJzJ7Kpx-sbc/viewform). This link will also be in the students guide.

#### Calendars

**Important Note:** Regardless of where you book time on these calendars, you are limited to 20 hours per week *total*. Please sign up for on-site hours as early as possible so we have a feel for what coverage to expect throughout the week.

The core Mentor role is to provide direct floor support or workshops on-site. However, Mentors are being pulled in many different directions outside this role. Such as:

- Info Panels
- Remote Mentoring for satellite locations
- Hackathon Support
- Community Outreach Events
- Tours
- Admissions
- Whatever else

We log these non-core activities separately because we are capped in how many hours we can book for core roles week to week. You will be shared on both calendars.

- SF Mentor Calendar - create slots for any on-site mentoring.
- SF Mentor Activities - create slots for all other events.

#### Meetings:
- 1st Monday of Phase @ 6:15 -- Optional powwow with Mentor Coordinator. Feel free to attend if you have questions or concerns.
- 1st Monday of Phase @ 7:00 -- Meet the Mentors for incoming Cohort. Need 4-8 Mentors to attend each phase.

#### How To Submit Your Hours in Workday:
[Video Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7uFhzfRtRRGSWlaWk1MS0ttb3gzaWJYenp3dlhPYl9nM253/view?usp=sharing)

1. Login
2. Go to the Time page
3. Submit daily session totals from the SF Mentor Calendar

#### Removal from the program:
Mentors are expected to uphold the three agreements and location specific rules at all times. Failure to do so will result in removal from the program.

Mentors are expected to work at least 5 hours a month to remain active in the program. Mentors working less than this will be contacted and asked to increase their hours or to retire from the program if they do not wish to work the minimum. Retired mentors can re-apply to the program at a later time. If you require a short term waiver (vacation, travel, etc) contact the Mentor Coordinator.
