#### Access to Cohort Orgs:
You need access to Cohort Orgs to perform code reviews and gain general insight of material on a phase. To accomplish this you have been added to the SF-Mentors team on GitHub. This team will be invited to each incoming cohort org, granting you full access to all material therein.

Access Issues: Ensure that you have accepted the invitation from Github for each active Cohort, else contact Mentor Coordinator.

#### Giving and Receiving Feedback:
- Complete the [Weekly Mentor Survey](https://docs.google.com/a/devbootcamp.com/forms/d/1aYZX7t737QJcIxmb25DCwcYPzKsxzgmiz_COOHjxj0I/viewform) weekly to talk about your experiences.
- Student feedback for Mentors will be collected during the weekly retro survey.
- You are required to solicit some student feedback each phase you work. This feedback will be reviewed by the Mentor Coordinator. Use the Give a [Mentor feedback form](https://docs.google.com/a/devbootcamp.com/forms/d/17gVpZgsiadJ9OblHMmxroAWAZcbKaQSyJzJ7Kpx-sbc/viewform). This link will also be in the students guide.

#### Meetings:
- 1st Monday of Phase @ 6:15 -- Optional powwow with Mentor Coordinator. Feel free to attend if you have questions or concerns.
- 1st Monday of Phase @ 7:00 -- Meet the Mentors for incoming Cohort. Need 4-8 Mentors to attend each phase.

#### How To Submit Your Hours in Workday:
[Video Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7uFhzfRtRRGSWlaWk1MS0ttb3gzaWJYenp3dlhPYl9nM253/view?usp=sharing)

1. Login
2. Go to the Time page
3. Submit daily session totals from the SF Mentor Calendar

#### Removal from the program:
Mentors are expected to uphold the three agreements and location specific rules at all times. Failure to do so will result in removal from the program.

Mentors are expected to work at least 5 hours a month to remain active in the program. Mentors working less than this will be contacted and asked to increase their hours or to retire from the program if they do not wish to work the minimum. Retired mentors can re-apply to the program at a later time. If require a short term waiver (vacation, travel, etc) contact the Mentor Coordinator.
