#### Signing Up For Shifts:
- Mentor shifts are created on the mentor appointments calendar - if you are a mentor [you can sign up here](https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUZObHZFNEpMRnV0fGRlZmF1bHR8MWY3MjM4NjgwOWQzZDBiNmEwYTFhNDIzYjNhMThkNTU)
 - Some shifts are assigned by mentor coordinators either because they are phase specific shifts during core hours, or a particular mentor has requested to own that shift (ie whiteboard wednesdays).
 - Open shifts may be filled by any mentor.  It is useful if you can claim open shifts a few days ahead of time so students know what support to expect, but they may be claimed as you walk in the door.
 - If there are no open shifts available on the time you want to mentor, you may request that additional shifts be created.

- See the video below for specifc instructions. **coming soon**

#### Before Your Shift:
- Review the challenges the students will be working by checking each of their phase guides. You can access these through the mentor GitHub account.

#### During Your Shift:
- Write your name and shift time on the board.
- Let the students know you're available.
- Sit at one of the small tables at the end of the student workstations so you're easily accessible.
- Check frequently for post-it flags on the computers.
- Take walks up and down the aisles every so often - some students don't ask questions unless you pass by.
- Nudge them in the right direction but don't give them the answer. Use your laptop to look up solutions from past cohorts if you're stuck.
- Don't spend too much time being stuck with a student - if you can't get them moving forward, ask another mentor or instructor.
- Additionally, you can do code reviews through the mentor GitHub account. See [below](#how-to-claim-a-pull-request-for-a-code-review) for instructions on how to do code reviews.
- If you're getting a lot of the same questions, consider doing a lightning talk on a topic. Check to see if the students would like one, and check in with the phase and/or cohort lead to see if there's any info from their lecture that they would like you to reinforce.

#### After Your Shift:
- Remove your name from the board.

#### Finding Coverage For Shifts:
- You must find coverage for shifts you no longer want to work, with the exceptions of personal emergencies (including interview requests). Use the mentor email list (mentors.sf@devbootcamp.com) to find coverage.
- Once someone has offered to pick up your shift, you need to delete yourself from the DBC::SF Mentor calendar (NOT YOUR PERSONAL CALENDAR).  This will open up the shift on the Mentor Calendar and the other mentor can sign up.

 1. Go to your Google calendar page and make sure that the DBC::SF Mentor Calendar is the only one selected. If you have your personal calendar displayed as well, you may inadvertantly delete the shift from your personal calendar instead of the DBC calendar. Your old shift WILL STILL BE VISIBLE on the DBC calendar, even though it is gone from your own calendar. You need to be sure to delete directly from the DBC calendar for this reason.
 2. Click on the shift you need to delete and then click the "Delete" link.
 3. A pop-up will appear - Choose either "Delete and update guests" or "Delete without updating", it doesn't matter.
 4. Inform the person picking up your shift that it's now available on the calendar.

#### How To Submit Your Hours in Workday
1. Login
2. Go to the Time page
3. Submit daily shift totals from the SF Mentor Calendar

#### Giving and Receiving Feedback:
A collection of student feedback on mentors will be sent once a week as well as a feedback form for mentors to fill out about their experience over the previous week.
You are required to have students submit some feedback on you each phase you work.  This feedbcak will be revied with the Mentor Coordinator. Use the Give a mentor feedback form **link coming soon**

#### Meetings:
Mentor meetings led by the Coordinator will occur on the first Monday of each phase.

#### How To Claim A Pull Request For A Code Review:
1. Click on the notifications icon in the upper right hand corner. Select "All Notifications" in the left-hand menu and check for any notifications that does not have the wizard hat image next to the timestamp ("4 days ago", "1 hour ago", etc).
2. Click on the un-wizard-hatted pull request and check to be sure an instructor hasn't already reviewed the code in the commments. If no one has commented yet, leave a note with your name stating that you'll do the code review.
3. Complete this during your shift - please do not leave the students hanging until the next time you work.
4. Do not work on code that has already been claimed.

#### How To Complete A Code Review:
1. After claiming it in the comments, click on the "File Changes" link directly above the student's initial comment.
2. Review the code in green, which indicates the changes that were made by the student to the file. Code in white was provided to them as part of the challenge.
3. Leave a comment in-line by clicking on the plus sign of the line in question and filling out the comment box.
4. When finished, click on the "Conversations" link and fill out a final summary comment ("Good job", "Here's a resource you may find useful", etc). Click "Close and Comment".
