## Who are the Mentors?
* Mentors are alumni who **volunteer their time** to come in and help current students. They are here to support you culturally, emotionally and technically. We pay them a little, but mostly they are here because they care about preserving the culture of DBC and contributing to your kick ass education.


## Where do I find Mentors?
* Before 6:00 - You will have at least one Mentor assigned to your phase. They will be out and about most times that you are coding on the floor.
* After 6:00 - Mentors will tac up their picture on the Mentor board when they come in. Their default location is at one of the end tables.

## What services can I expect from a Mentor?

* Ask a Mentor for a code review. Either delivered in person or via GitHub.
* You should ask them to pair, but please keep in mind they cannot stay with you all night. Lots of students, you know, so if demand is high they are obligated to spread the knowledge around.
* If several members of your cohort are struggling with a concept, consider _asking_ a Mentor to give a breakout.
* Excellent conversation. Maybe you just need to talk and bounce ideas around.

## Working with Mentors

* **Just tell me how to do it!**

Mentors are not here to give you the answer to a particular problem. Maybe that happens, but it's not their focus.

They may help you get unstuck, they may point you in a better direction, they may spend some time to address concepts related to but not pertaining to the challenge you are working on.

Their primary directive is to assist in cultivating your ability to diagnose, debug, and get through difficult issues on your own. Technical instruction is a firm second place here.

* **All the things**

Mentors are not Gods. They are former students. They have a high degree of empathy towards boots, having been exactly where you are now not too long ago.

Moral: _Mentors do not know everything_ (Protip: NOBODY DOES!).

So take what you can from each interaction and make the rest happen by whatever means necessary.
