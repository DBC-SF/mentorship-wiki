## Sessions

A session is time that you book to Mentor @ DBC. If you book a session you are expected to show up for that time slot. Session bookings will be cross-referenced to your Workday submissions.

### Booking:

#### Signing Up For Sessions:
Mentors are added to the Mentor Calendar after they are accepted to the program. If you cannot access this Google calendar, email the Mentor Coordinator for assistance.

- Mentor sessions can be created on the Mentor Appointments Calendar.
- Some sessions are assigned by the Mentor Coordinator or Phase Lead either because they are phase specific sessions during core hours, or a particular mentor has requested to own that session (IE. Intro to JS Workshop).
- It is useful if you book sessions a few days ahead of time so students and other Mentors know what support to expect, but they may be claimed as you walk in the door.

- See the video below for a demo. **coming soon**

#### Canceling Sessions:

If you book a session on the calendar but are unable to make it:

Go to your Google calendar.
Click on the session you need to delete and then click the "Cancel Appointment" link.
Next click 'Delete and Update Guests'.
Shoot me an email and let me know about the cancellation. I will email out to find a replacement.

#### Fixed Sessions:
Fixed sessions are workshops conducted by a Mentor. They can occur anytime after 6 on weekdays, or anytime over the weekend.

Taking on a Fixed session means taking on additional responsibilities. Mentors working on a fixed session may bill a limited number of 'prep hours' in addition to the actual time of the session.

Once scheduled, a fixed session should occur roughly at the same time and interval. Changes or substitutions need to be discussed with the Mentor Coordinator in advance. You may consider pairing with another Mentor for these, thus allowing some degree of flexibility while maintaining consistent deliver to students.

There are several fixed sessions available. If someone hasn't claimed a session you are interested in email the Mentor Coordinator to discuss picking it up.

### Session Cadence:

#### Before a Session:
- Review the challenges the students will be working by checking each of their phase guides. You can access these through your GitHub account. If you do not have access email the Mentor Coordinator.

#### During a Session:
- Write your name and session time on the board.
- Let the students know you're available.
- Sit at one of the tables at the end of the student workstations so you're easily accessible.
- Check frequently for post-it flags on the computers.
- Take walks up and down the aisles every so often - some students don't ask questions unless you pass by.
- Nudge them in the right direction but don't give them the answer. Use your laptop to look up solutions from past cohorts if you're stuck.
- Don't spend too much time being stuck with a student - if you can't get them moving forward, ask another mentor or instructor.
- Additionally, you should do code reviews. See [how to conduct code reviews](code-review.md) for instructions on how to do code reviews.
- If you're getting a lot of the same questions, consider doing a breakout on a topic. Check to see if the students would like one, and consider checking in with the phase lead to see if there's any info from their lecture that they would like you to reinforce.

#### After a Session:
- Remove your name from the board.
- Complete the [End of Session](https://docs.google.com/a/devbootcamp.com/forms/d/1bNIBtgy2ephY5117eHa31iFVgVRxPJAA0zzyeEqvTlA/viewform) form.
