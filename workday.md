#### How do I enter time when working in multiple circles as a mentor, interviewer, and/or Phase 0 guide?

You need to carefully track and separate the hours that you work for each circle.  Code each increment of time to the appropriate cost center.

When working as a mentor, code that time to the Local Circle cost center:
- New York: UY7258
- San Francisco: UY7199
- Chicago: UY7200

When working as an interviewer, code that time to the Admissions cost center: UY708842

When working as a Phase 0 guide, code that time to the Phase 0 cost center: UY708833

Note that your primary focus should be on finding a full-time job, so your total hours should stay at or below 20 hours per week.  If you are scheduled to work in excess of 20 hours during any given week, please reach out to your Local Lead Link for guidance.
