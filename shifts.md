# Shifts

A shift is time that you book via the Deputy app to Mentor @ DBC. If you book a shift you are expected to show up for that time slot. Shifts signups will be cross-referenced to actual hours logged as well as your Workday timesheet.

Shift scheduling and shift tracking are handled exclusively via Deputy.

For information on how to interface with this system please read the [DBC Deputy Docs](deputy.md).

### Shift Cadence:

#### Before a Shift:
- Review the challenges the students will be working on by checking each of their phase guides in the respective cohort organizations. You can access these through your GitHub account. If you do not have access email the Mentor Coordinator.

#### During a Shift:
- Sign in for your shift via the [Deputy Mobile App](https://www.deputy.com/mobile).
- Your name and profile picture will be displayed on DBC-Infowall
- Still, please let the students know you're available.
- Take walks up and down the aisles every so often - some students don't ask questions unless you pass by.
- Sit at one of the tables at the end of the student workstations so you're easily accessible.
- Check regularly for students in a state of need.
- No questions from students... Break the ice with some general conversation angeling towards setting DBC culture.
- Nudge them in the right direction but don't regularly give them the answer straight up.
- Conduct quick 20-30 minute breakouts whenever you notice a group of students struggling around the same topic.
- If you notice bad habits starting to form, shut them down.
- Encourage clean code and 'best practices'.
- Use your laptop to look up solutions from past cohort orgs if you're stuck.
- Don't spend too much time being stuck with a student - if you can't get them moving forward, ask another Mentor or Instructor.
- Remember, being a Mentor isn't all technical. Try to set a culture of hard work, kindness, determination, self empowerment and all around joyful interactions amongst humans and the code they play with.
- Additionally, you can do code reviews. See [how to conduct code reviews](code-review.md) for instructions on how to do code reviews.

#### After a shift:
- Submit [End of shift](https://docs.google.com/a/devbootcamp.com/forms/d/1bNIBtgy2ephY5117eHa31iFVgVRxPJAA0zzyeEqvTlA/viewform) form. (1 minute)
- Log any impactful interactions in [students notes](https://mentor.devbootcamp.com/) (1-5 minutes)
- Logout via the Mentor Kiosk (1 minute)

#### Misc Shift Notes:

- Shifts allow for the Mentor hours to be consumed across a phase where they will have the greatest impact.
- Shift times are a solid guideline but do not have to be adhered to exactly. You can +- an hour here and there so long as your total hours for the day remain unchanged.
- If you miss an shift without finding a replacement or informing the Mentor Coordinator in advance, your shifts for the rest of the phase will be forfeit.

#### Workshops:

There are several Workshops available.
  - White-boarding Wednesdays **John Akers**
  - Intro to Javascript Week 1 weekend **Stephanie Hutson / Xander Peterson**
  - Intro to Sinatra - Phase transition weekend **Kevin Serrano**
  - Intro to Git Workflow - Week 1 Thursday **Hanah Yendler**
  - Intro to ReactJS - Week 2 Sunday **Lu DeCastro**
  - Intro to ReactNative - Week 2 Thursday **Lu DeCastro**
  - Advanced Git Workflow w/ ReBase - **OPEN**
  - Intro to Rails - Phase transition weekend **OPEN**
  - Intro to JS Framework (your choice) - Week 2 Saturday **OPEN**
  - ... (Suggestions Welcome)

Workshops occur anytime after 6 on weekdays, or anytime over the weekend.

Taking on a workshop means taking on additional responsibilities. (Preparing quality content, recurring time commitments, more challenging student interactions)

Mentors working on a workshop may bill a limited number of 'prep hours' in addition to the actual time of the shift. Applicable Prep hours are determined and approved by the Mentor Coordinator.

Once scheduled, a workshop should occur roughly at the same time and interval each phase. Changes or substitutions need to be discussed with the Mentor Coordinator in advance. You may consider pairing with another Mentor or two on a particular workshop, thus allowing some degree of flexibility while maintaining consistent delivery to students.

Email or chat with the Mentor Coordinator to discuss picking up a workshop.

#### Mentor Usage in Other Roles:

**Important Note:** Regardless of what you are working on over the week, you are limited to 20 hours per week *total* without specific approval of the Mentor Coordinator.

The core Mentor role is to provide direct floor support or workshops on-site. However, Mentors are being pulled in many different directions outside this role. Such as:

- Info Panels
- Remote Mentoring for satellite locations
- Hackathon Support
- Community Outreach Events
- Admissions
- Whatever else

**Important Note:** If you are working for another department outside core DBC floor support, that department must provide you with a cost center code PRIOR to you starting a shift. This code will be required when submitting time in [Workday](workday.md).

These non-core shifts may be shown on the Deputy signup page but most likely you will be working outside a preexisting shift. If the shift does exist just signup/signin as usual otherwise...

**Logging an Unscheduled Shift:**

- Use you mobile device or the Deputy Kiosk to signin for your shift.
- Scroll down the list of areas until you find the right one and select it.
- Use you mobile device or the Deputy Kiosk to signout for your shift.
- Enter a note describing the work performed during the unscheduled shift.
- All non-scheduled shifts will have a timesheet marked 'Pending Approval' upon completion.


#### Dayside Shifts: (AKA: Core Team)

Shifts that occur M-F during core hours @ DBC are considered part of the 'Dayside Team'
Mentors are selected for the dayside team based on feedback from students, DBC instructor observations and most importantly how engaged you were as a student during DBC.

Currently the core team is broken down **generally** as follows:

Shifts:
- 1 AM shift  per day per phase
- 2 PM shifts per day per phase
- No Phase 3 shifts after final project start.

Mentor Types:
- Cohort Mentor
- Phase Mentor
- Floating Mentor

**Cohort Mentor**

A Mentor that will most likely follow a given cohort through the program.

Typically this starts in Phase 1, although we do replace Cohort Mentors when a Mentor gets a job.

The single AM shift is reserved first for the Cohort Mentor and should be predominantly filled by the Cohort Mentor. Other Core Team Mentors can book the AM shift only after they see that the Cohort Mentor has taken slots for the week.

Taking on the Cohort Mentor role bears additional responsibilities:

  - Tighter feedback loop with DBC staff
  - Cultural leadership
  - Increased expectation for leading breakouts
  - Increased expectation for conducting Github code reviews
  - Stronger scheduling commitment

**Phase Mentor**

Phase Mentors focus their efforts on a specific phase.

  - Focus on a specific phase
  - Leads to an increase in comfort with the material / better overall technical delivery to students.
  - Shifts should be primarily in one phase for some length of time.
  - Phase Mentors can schedule a few shifts here and there to fill gaps in coverage, just ensure the majority of your shifts are from your phase.

**Floating Mentor**

- Free to plug in plug out wherever.
- Only 1-2 Core Team Mentors will be Floating Mentors.
- Most flex in schedule as this Mentor is utilized extensively to fill gaps in the schedule.

**Filling Mentor Types on the Dayside Team:**

As of now it is my belief that the members of the Core Team are capable of sorting out who can or should go where based on your needs / wants / abilities as a group. You are a small team, leaving it in your hands provides much needed flexibility for that other thing called life and that other other thing called the search. If that doesn't work out I can go back to picking who for when myself, but I think this way is way better if you approach it in a collaborative manner.

#### Campus Tours

There are two Campus Tours shifts scheduled per week. On Tuesday and Thursday from 4:00-6:00.

Mentors signing up for tours should be extra outgoing, positive, enjoy talking about their DBC experience and be comfortable taking delivery notes from Andrew in marketing.

**Cost Center Note:** These scheduled shifts are covered under DBC SF budget and treated as part of 'Mentor Core Delivery' no need to enter the marketing cost center when filling out time in Workday.
