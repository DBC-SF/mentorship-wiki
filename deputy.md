**Scheduling Details:**

  - Shifts for the upcoming phase will be published during week 2 of a phase.
  - You will receive an email notification that shifts are available.
  - Signin to Deputy whenever you like to claim shifts.

**Deputy Side Notes:**


- You can access Deputy via web or native mobile app.
- Upload your (super nice looking cause it will be displayed on the infowall during your shift) profile pic via the circle edit in 'My Profile' not the section under 'Edit My Global Profile'. The interface there is buggy.
- The Kiosk takes a picture when you signin/signout. Yes I know it's dumb but it makes admin really giddy on the inside. We don't keep the photo's. Photos are stored on the Deputy DB and wiped along with all other data when/if you are offboarded from DBC.
- I really didn't like the name Deputy at first, it has an under the thumb connotation that's no good. But it's grown on me. Two points as a historical aside:
  - Coaches => Core Coaches => Teaching Assistants => Mentors
  - Sherif Abushadi ran the original Coaches program.
- So in some genealogical sense we're all kinda his deputies... Historical aside aside and back to the subject at hand, I tested several of these products with a few mentors and this was the best thing going.
- The app is capable of more than we need and that's OK. Just stick with the functionality detailed within the Wiki.
- Feedback encouraged
