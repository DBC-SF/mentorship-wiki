# Set Scheduling for Core Mentors

Given 5 Core mentors. 2 for Phase 1, 2 for Phase 2.

Phase 1 and 2 will have a Phase Mentor and a Cohort Mentor.
Phase 3 will have just their Cohort Mentor.

Since there will only be 2 Mentors for Phases 1 and 2, scheduling is easy.

- Whomever are the 2 Mentors for Phase 1 and 2 get together to figure out their own scheduling constraints.

- Both Mentors will take 3 full shift days out of the week.
- Obviously 1 day will overlap. (This day can be the day when there are no teachers available)

- At this point both mentors will be at 18hrs total and there are 4 afternoon shifts still available.
- They then have the option of picking up an extra afternoon shift left over to cap at 20(or give to other mentors) which leaves 2 open shifts.

- Those shifts can either be omitted or given up to the other mentors. ( Omitted due to group projects or graduation type stuffs )

- After 3 weeks, The Phase 3 Cohort Mentor and any of the Phase Mentors can then decide on switching for the new cohort.
