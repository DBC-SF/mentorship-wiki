## Joby Job Type Things:

I want all the jobs for all the Boots. The reason is two fold:

1. You all put something very real on the line to be a Boot. I know that sacrifice well and deeply desire successful outcomes for every single Boot that took the plunge, put in the work and now faces the open job market.
2. Mentor Developers are an amazing resource to the DBC community.

To that end you all have to put up with the Mentor Coordinator hassling you about your job search. If it was my only thing to do I would do it all day.

Hopefully through your own efforts, perhaps in conjunction with the a some prodding from myself, you will arrive in a situation where the hassle is no longer required, leading me to turn the [hassle off](https://cdn.meme.am/instances/64781993.jpg). This is the desired outcome above all other. I fully expect you to contribute even more effort to the job search than your peers. You are engaged with code nearly everyday and as such your sharpness continues to be topnotch. Don't let that asset go to waste. It is my utmost hope that you will one day soon leave me totally hanging for next Mondays shift because someone else offered to give you dollar dollar bills to write some kick ass code. That my friends is 100% A-OK. Just don't forget to come back to the evening team in a few months once you settled. Pretty please ;-)

Along the same lines but more Debbie Downer, if the Careers team or the Mentor Coordinator feel that your participation in the Mentor Program is negatively impacting your job search your hours can be reduced or even eliminated. So stay after it.

*The section below is editorial in nature, so all IMHO.*

And as a parting thought: If you haven't heard this story from me I'm sorry. But here's a heads up on the job search.

**The Job Search is HARD!**

Getting your first gig with no experience in SF **will be a daunting affair**. That's not a DBC thing, that's a just life thing. You have to keep at it with a burning fire in your soul or the chances of success will begin to diminish. Fire means intensity of effort through time allocation, unyielding faith that you will meet your goals and diligence for doing the parts you don't like. Or better said:

- Maintain Positivity: This is first because it is by far the most important.
  - Keep a growth mindset, don't see dead-ends as failures but rather [opportunities to learn and improve](http://www.dailyfailcentral.com/sites/default/files/styles/fail/public/fail/aQ4Z5wr_700b_v1.jpg?itok=btbnsTy7).
  - It's a battle, and sometimes that battle can be long. There's no denying that some high quality boots have languished for a bit due to plain ol bad luck. Your stamina for rolling with the punches and keeping your chin up will be a crucial component in your ultimate success. If you don't enforce a positive attitude about your search the whole world will see it in you it will feed into itself and will ultimately reduce your odds in the market place considerably.
  - Believe that if you keep working at it you will find success. I know time is not your friend, we all have a runway and it drives our sense of urgency. That said, time is not wholly your enemy it can be an ally if you use it properly. Over time you will polish your online presence. You will meet people that know people and like you for a position. Your coding and interview skills will increase. Your portfolio will grow. Maybe you build out a few freelance gigs of your own creation for Mo's Freak Pizza Shack in Duluth... Presto Chango before you know it you're no longer an 'Unexperienced Developer'. Moral of the story: Leverage your time wisely with a belief that enough input will produce the desired output and all will be well.. Eventually.
  - Believe in yourself. If you are in an interview room lose the concept that you are not good enough to be there. Put away the nervous attitude and replace it with calm in the moment because a little known secret exists. If you are in the room someone else already believes you're good enough to be there. Your job is provide them with positive reinforcement of that concept.
  - There's no place in the job search, interview process or salary negotiations for your superego. No one wants an employee that doesn't believe in themselves. Approach every situation with a mindset that you are *the* right person for the task with the skills needed to knock it out of the park. The world will see that reflected in you, dramatically increasing the odds of success.
- Send out 20-30 resumes each week. To wherever you can find that even closely resembles your stack.
- Take as many phone screens and technical interviews as you can, even with companies you're not extremely excited about. You build skill and there's always a chance they will offer you a job.
- Keep learning new things at breakneck speed. Your Github / Portfolio are a *Massive Asset* in your search.
- Goto at least 1 Meetup **outside DBC** a week. AND **Actually talking to people there.** Make connections, learn about things, strut your stuff.
- Remember looking for a job is a full time job.
  - 20HR/week Applying / Searching / Interviewing
  - 10HR/week Learning / Building / Contributing / Refactoring
  - 5-7HR/week Meetups / Out of your Comfort Zone / Meetups
  - 5-7HR/week Collaborating / Maintaining Accountability Relationships
- If someone offers you a coding job, even if it's not that great, you should really consider taking it. Previous Job Experience is the number one thing standing between where you are today and where you want to be as a Developer. Work the gig 6 months or so, get stable and start looking again. You'll be amazed how much easier it is with experience under your belt and no runway looming overhead.
