### FAQ

_Is the 5 hours per month a minimum per month, or an average over multiple months?_

This is per month.  Since mentors are now part time employees, there is a limit to the number that we can have active.  We would like our active mentors to meet a minimum level of engagement. If you are planning a trip that will prohibit you from meeting this minimum you may speak wit the Mentor Coordinator about a waiver.

The Commuter Benefits Program allows you to set aside pre-tax money for out-of-pocket, work-related parking and/or mass transit commuting expenses.

Examples of eligible expenses can include a paid parking facility at or near your place or work, commuter trains, subways, buses, ferries, and van pooling (with at least six passengers).

_For things like coordinating the phase transition workshop (Intro to Sinatra), how does that fit into the booking sessions?_

We have Fixed Sessions on the calendar for existing events.  These will be pre-assigned to the main person (though if that person can’t do it they can pass it off). For example Whiteboard Wednesday will be a pre-assigned Fixed Session that is automatically assigned to John. Also the Sinatra Workshop would be a Fixed Session. The mentor who wants to run one of these would need to connect with the Mentor Coordinator to set the time and day.

If there are additional Fixed Sessions that any mentor would like to have - they can request this from the Mentor Coordinator who will assess the number of mentoring hours available against the need for such a session.

There may be title advancement in the future - Need to get the program up and running first.

There will not be opportunities for pay increase.
