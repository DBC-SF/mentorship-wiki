### FAQ

_Is the 5 hours per month a minimum per month, or an average over multiple months?_

This is per month.  Since mentors are now part time employees, there is a limit to the number that we can have active.  We would like our active mentors to meet a minimum level of engagement. If you are planning a trip that will prohibit you from meeting this minimum you may speak wit the Mentor Coordinator about a waiver.

This number may change based on student demand and mentor availability.

_What are the details of the commuter benefits?_

The Commuter Benefits Program allows you to set aside pre-tax money for out-of-pocket, work-related parking and/or mass transit commuting expenses. Your election may be changed monthly, based on your changing transit needs. Expenses are limited to eligible commuter parking and/or mass transit expenses incurred by you. Examples of eligible expenses can include a paid parking facility at or near your place or work, commuter trains, subways, buses, ferries, and van pooling (with at least six passengers). For parking you may set aside up to $250 per month in 2015. For mass transit, you may set aside up to $130 per month in 2015.

_For things like coordinating the phase transition workshop (Intro to Sinatra), how does that fit into the booking shifts?_

We have Fixed Shifts on the schedule for existing workshops. These will be pre-assigned to the main person (though if that person can’t do it they can pass it off). For example Whiteboard Wednesday will be a pre-assigned workshop that is automatically assigned to John or Jack. Also the Sinatra Workshop would be a Fixed Shift. The mentor who wants to run one of these would need to connect with the Mentor Coordinator to set the time and day.

If there are additional Workshops that any mentor would like to have - they can request this from the Mentor Coordinator who will assess the number of mentoring hours available against the need for such a shift.

_Are there opportunities for title advancement/pay increase?_
